# A brief of the prototype
### Geopedia
A one stop platform for all you Geological needs.<br>
#### What's the issue ?
Data available to Geologists from NASA satellites are unarranged, unlabeled and hard to understand.
Satellites scan the earth in form of blocks and it becomes hard to differentiate data like RADAR scans, EMIT(Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation) data, SAR(Synthetic aperture radar) data, etc,. on the basis of location's conventional name. 
#### How do we solve the issue !?
We collect and catalogue goelogical data from satellite and present it to the user using Google maps API. This makes it easier for the user to locate the particular land that he/she needs to access the dataset of.
